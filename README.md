# Week 8 Sorting - House Objects

## Objective

The Week 8 Sorting project aimed to implement and demonstrate sorting of custom objects in Java. The program creates a list of house objects, each with attributes like square footage, price, number of rooms, style, and color, and then sorts the list using the QuickSort algorithm.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing and using custom classes in Java (`house` class).
- Creating and manipulating `ArrayList` of objects.
- Implementing QuickSort algorithm for object sorting.
- Writing comparison logic via the `compareTo` method.
- Debugging and verifying sorting operations for complex data types.

### Tools Used

- Java programming language.
- `ArrayList` for dynamic collection management.
- QuickSort algorithm for sorting objects efficiently.
- Standard input/output for displaying the list before and after sorting.
